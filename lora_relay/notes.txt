Master dev key (generated and stored on build host, keep secret)
AppKey and NwkKey also stored on build host and provisioned to devices and join server

-> derive per-device root key using master key and hwid
 -> provision per-device root key to HMAC upstream eFuse
 -> encrypt AppKey and NwkKey with per-device root key and write to flash

Device's eFuse stores per-device root key and uses this to decrypt AppKey and NwkKey, which
are then used in the LoRaWAN stack. For devices without secure storage, the hashed hardware
ID should be used as the per-device root key (somewhat less secure) to decrypt the AppKey
and NwkKey.

Devices need to be tracked with:
- hardware ID
- per-device root key

x generate root keys
x write root key to efuse
x generate derived key from entropy
x encrypt secrets with derived key
x flash secrets and entropy to device
x decrypt secrets at runtime
